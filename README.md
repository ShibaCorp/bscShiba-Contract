   Shiba Inu on Binance Chain
   
   Shibaâ€™s master made a lot of monies on the Ethereum network. 
   So they decided to recreate Shiba on BSC, with a fairer launch so everyone can play with Shiba without fear of dusty dogs dumping on them.
   
   Shiba was launched on the eth network with 10 eth starting liquidity at a price of about $300 per eth. 
   Shiba will do the same on BSC but with a higher starting BNB price which means more liquidity! 
   Shiba will also implement a passive yield mechanic where 5% of each transaction is distributed to holders,
   making for an upgraded meme token with lower network fees!
